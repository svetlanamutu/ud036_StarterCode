# Movie Trailers Web Page Generator Source Code

This repository contains the source code of the Movie Trailers application written in Python version 3.7.0 which generates a web page with my favorite movies with their trailers.

## Installation and usage
This application was tested in Python 3.7.0.

- First download and install Python 3.7.0 or higher and clone the repository containing the Movie Trailers source code.  
- Open the _entertainment_center.py_ file in Python IDLE and run it (in IDLE menu, click on 'Run'->'Run Module' option). A web page will be generated and opened in a browser.
- Click on any movie picture and its youtube trailer will show up and play the trailer.

## Possible issues
Older Python versions may not work with this code since some libraries changed in 3.7.0 version.

## Notes
You will notice that there are two image files in this repository: LifeOfPi.jpg and TheIntouchables.jpg. The reason why these image files are not opened from a remote location, like the images of the other two movies, is that I could not easily find them in Wikimedia.
